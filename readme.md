This is the microservice architecture for the backend services for one of my mobile applications that I created (can be found here). 

It was previously made using a monolithic form, but switched architecture design to allow for scalability, loose coupling and future deployment.  

## User services 

This includes the user, owner and restaurant services. 


## Cloud Gateway
